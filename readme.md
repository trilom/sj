# I'm glad this guy is getting his shit.

- A handful of others and I filed reports to NCREC (Real Estate) commission back in 2016/2017.
- I was interviewed a couple of times under oath about his charges.
- Shortly before my subpoenaed court date he finally stopped fighting (like a baby) accepted his punishment.
- He has drug an ex girlfriend/(wife) through the court system for a long time just to be mean.
- The result of this meant he lost his real estate license. The core reason he lost it was because he was offering rental services and doing it poorly.

So you had a change of heart? I'll be happy to fix it, as I promised I would, I just wish I knew of some way to satisfy your concerns with my business practices. I can't honestly believe a cheap mug at closing would have done the trick. I'm super full this week, I could probably take a look on wednesday. Do you know what kind of set up the faucets are? Is it attached to a shower? what kind of fixture? delta, moen, etc....
